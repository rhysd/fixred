# [v1.1.3](https://github.com/rhysd/fixred/releases/tag/v1.1.3) - 30 Sep 2021

- Ignore non-UTF8 files. This is useful when you specify some directories to update files recursively. Now fixred simply ignores non-UTF8 file. Previously fixred stopped when finding a non-UTF8 file. To know which files were ignored, try `--verbose` flag.

[Changes][v1.1.3]

# [v1.1.2](https://github.com/rhysd/fixred/releases/tag/v1.1.2) - 29 Sep 2021

- Dependencies necessary only for building `fixred` executable are now optional. By removing `executable` feature, they can be omit on installing this tool as Rust library for less dependencies.
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  fixred = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = [] }
  ```
- Add an introduction dedicated for [the API document](https://docs.rs/fixred/). Previously `README.md` file at root of this repository was used but it is basically for `fixred` executable.
